## Taming the syllabus jungle

Ever felt like you're playing hide-and-seek with your course information? Syllabase is here to end that game. It's the app that turns your dense, text-heavy syllabuses into sleek, actionable dashboards. No more scrolling through pages of PDF just to find out when your next essay is due.

## Why we built it

- Syllabuses are information goldmines... buried under formatting avalanches.
- Students spend more time decoding syllabuses than actually using them.
- We love a good challenge, and making sense of academic documents is up there with rocket science.
- Sleep is overrated when you can code with friends instead.

## Why the cool kids love syllabase

- **Azure-powered parsing**: We've got cloud muscle to crunch through those PDFs.
- **ChatGPT smarts**: AI that actually understands what "pop quiz every other Tuesday" means.
- **Visual feast**: Turn boring text into beautiful, interactive dashboards.
- **Grade breakdown at a glance**: Know exactly what that participation grade is worth.
- **Deadline defense**: Never miss an important date again.


Syllabase isn't just an app; it's your academic lifeline. It's for anyone who's ever wished their syllabus came with a user manual.
