      ## Problem 
      When I was looking to showcase my projects on my portfolio, I
      found that the market lacked an intuitive and easily accessible tool for
      creating visually stunning marketing content. Many turned to applications
      like Figma or Photoshop, but these tools proved overwhelming in their
      complexity, not beginner-friendly, or required a steep financial
 
 
      ## Constraints 
      The project had to navigate key limitations, such as
      delivering a high-quality user experience within the confines of a browser
      environment and striking a balance between simplicity and functionality.
      Furthermore, the solution needed to offer a way to save or export projects
      without demanding user account creation.
