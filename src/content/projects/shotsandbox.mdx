## Transforming Screenshots into Stunning Visuals
In seeking a tool for showcasing projects on my portfolio, I realized the market's gap in offering easy-to-use tools for creating professional visuals. This led me to develop ShotSandbox. Aimed at transforming plain screenshots into captivating visuals, ShotSandbox stands out for its simplicity and accessibility, contrasting with more complex platforms like Figma or Photoshop. It's tailored for those needing a straightforward solution to elevate their marketing visuals.
 ## The Philosophy Behind ShotSandbox
 In creating ShotSandbox, I prioritized simplicity and ease of use, recognizing the complexity and feature overload in tools like Photoshop and Figma. Understanding the need for a more approachable solution, ShotSandbox focuses on fulfilling its niche without overwhelming users with excessive features. A key aspect was enabling users to work on their projects without the requirement of creating an account. By utilizing dexie.js, a browser database wrapper built on IndexedDB, ShotSandbox allows users to save their work directly in the browser. This approach not only respects user privacy by keeping data local but also lowers the barrier to entry, encouraging more people to try the app without the commitment of signing up.
## Enhancing ShotSandbox with Multi-Layer Support
ShotSandbox is poised for significant enhancements to increase its versatility. Plans include introducing multi-layer support, allowing for more complex layouts and the addition of annotation tools like arrows, shapes, and text blocks. A major user experience upgrade is transitioning from drag sliders to a more intuitive drag-and-drop system with resize handles for layer positioning, similar to tools like Figma and Photoshop. Coupled with these changes, a more advanced state management system will be implemented to boost the editor's responsiveness and user interaction efficiency.
