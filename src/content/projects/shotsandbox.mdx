  # Details

  
      ## Problem 
      When I was looking to showcase my projects on my portfolio, I
      found that the market lacked an intuitive and easily accessible tool for
      creating visually stunning marketing content. Many turned to applications
      like Figma or Photoshop, but these tools proved overwhelming in their
      complexity, not beginner-friendly, or required a steep financial
 
 
      ## Constraints 
      The project had to navigate key limitations, such as
      delivering a high-quality user experience within the confines of a browser
      environment and striking a balance between simplicity and functionality.
      Furthermore, the solution needed to offer a way to save or export projects
      without demanding user account creation.

  # Process

  
      ## Objectives 
      The core goal was to create a web-based application that
      enables users to craft high-impact marketing content with ease. From
      uploading screenshots to customizing backgrounds, it was vital for the
      platform to be user-friendly, cross-platform, feature-rich, and affordable
      while also maintaining reliability.


      ## Challenges 
      Developing a tool that delivers a plethora of features
      without becoming too complex posed a significant challenge. Additionally,
      implementing seamless project storage without requiring user accounts, and
      maintaining high performance in a browser environment were key obstacles
      to overcome.

  # Conclusion

  
      ## Approach 
      The app was designed with a user-centric approach, leveraging
      Dexie.js, an IndexedDB wrapper library to facilitate anonymous project
      storage in the browser. A careful selection of features was made to avoid
      overwhelming users while still offering high-level functionality, like
      adding custom gradient backgrounds, browser frames, captions, and more.

   
      ## Final Thoughts 
      The journey of creating this application was filled with
      learning opportunities and complex challenges. However, the result is a
      tool that democratizes the creation of professional-grade marketing
      content, breaking down the barriers of cost and complexity that typically
