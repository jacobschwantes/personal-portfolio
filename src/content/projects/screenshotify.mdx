      ## Problem 
      Users often need to take screenshots of various websites for different purposes, whether it be for testing, record-keeping, design work, or content creation. However, current implementations are lacking in either affordability, features, or performance.
    </Block>
    <Block>
      ## Constraints
      Since affordability is a key factor, the solution must be cost efficient to run and maintain. The solution must also be able to offer more advanced features than current implementations, and be able to do so quickly and reliably.

  # Conclusion

      ## Approach 
      To minimize computational overhead, I leveraged serverless functions deployed on Google Cloud Platform where you only pay for active execution time. This also allowed for easy horizontal scaling to effectively handle dynamic user loads. To ensure accurate rendering, I chose Puppeteer as my headless browser for its extensive features and maintainability.

      ## Final Thoughts 
      This project was a great learning experience for me as it allowed me to explore the world of serverless computing and headless browsers. I also learned a lot about designing a clean and intuitive dashboard that offers powerful functionality without overwhelming the user. I plan to continue working on this project to add more features and to improve the user experience.
