## Screenshotify: Capturing the Web
Screenshotify is a tool that simplifies the process of capturing high-resolution screenshots of web pages. 
Born out of a need to quickly render responsive websites as images, it leverages a virtual browser environment to efficiently render pages and capture screenshots.
## Behind the Scenes
Built with a focus on user experience, Screenshotify offers a comprehensive dashboard for managing usage stats, history logs, and access keys. 
The tool incorporates features like persistent cloud storage, SSL termination, high availability through horizontally scaled serverless functions, and fine-grained access key control. 
## Performance improvements
Optimizing Screenshotify presented unique challenges, particularly in enhancing performance. 
One key improvement was the integration of an ad blocker, which considerably increased page load speeds. 
Another crucial aspect involved refining the process for API key quota look-ups which
helped reduce database reads and minimized network round trips, improving the overall efficiency and responsiveness of the service. 
These improvements were the easiest to implement but further optimization can be done to improve the performance of page loads as that is the biggest source of latency in the application.
