## Capturing the Web, One Page at a Time

Ever needed to capture hundreds of high-res screenshots of responsive websites? Probably not, but some people do, ok! (Looking at you, bleary-eyed QA testers chugging your fifth espresso.) Screenshotify was born to scratch that itch. It's not just a tool; it's a peek into the world of API design and cloud architecture.

## Why I Built It
- Manual screenshots? Ain't nobody got time for that.
- Existing tools? Either clunky or pricey.
- My coffee machine suggested I need a more complex project.
- I had a browser tab open to "How to build scalable web services" anyway.

## What Made Screenshotify Tick

1. **Virtual browser magic**: Puppeteer rendering web pages faster than you can say "cheese!"
2. **User-friendly dashboard**: Because who doesn't love pretty graphs and logs?
3. **Cloud-powered**: Serverless functions and persistent storage, oh my!

## Under the Hood: A Learning Playground

- **Ad-blocking boost**: Because ads are the nemesis of load times.
- **API key optimization**: Fewer database reads, happier servers, happier wallets.
- **Cold start combat**: Keeping instances warm like fresh coffee.

## What I Learned (Besides How to Spell 'Screenshot')

1. Dashboards are like gardens – they need constant tending.
2. Google Cloud Platform: It's not just for Googlers anymore.
3. Serverless isn't just a buzzword; it's a lifestyle choice.

Screenshotify wasn't just about capturing web pages; it was about capturing the essence of building a scalable web service. While it may be archived now, the lessons learned continue to render clearly in my developer journey.
Remember, folks: Always optimize your cold starts, and never underestimate the power of a good ad blocker!
