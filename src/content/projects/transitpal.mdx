## TransitPal: Your eco-friendly transit companion

Ever wondered how much you're saving the planet (and your wallet) by taking the bus? No? Well, we did, and that's how TransitPal was born in a caffeine-fueled 24-hour hackathon frenzy!

## What's the deal?
TransitPal is a web app that turns your boring commute data into
a guilt-trip... I mean, a visual celebration of your environmental and financial
savviness. Simply log your public transit trips and watch as the app showers you
with colorful graphs of your planet-saving prowess.

## The tech behind the magic

- **Next.js**: Because we like our React with a side of server-side rendering
- **Firebase**: For when you need a database that's as sleepless as a hackathon team
- **TailwindCSS**: Making our app look pretty, even at 4 AM
- **Google Maps API**: Helping us navigate the treacherous waters of geolocation

## Challenges? We've got 'em!

Our plans hit a speed bump when our chosen API required email approval for access, and time wasn't on our side. Meanwhile, Google Maps decided to play hard to get, throwing security errors our way and proving trickier to integrate than we'd hoped. But in true hackathon spirit, we pushed through!
