## Where Picasso meets party games

You know that moment when you're trying to draw a giraffe, but it looks more like a deformed lamppost? Welcome to Sketch with Friends, where artistic talent is optional, but laughs are guaranteed. This isn't just another drawing game; it's a digital playground where your terrible stick figures can finally shine.

## How we keep it fun

- Room creation: Create your own digital art studio, minus the paint smell.
- Take turns drawing: It's not just about the art; it's about the journey.
- Best practices: We're serious about our silly drawings.

Sketch with Friends is for anyone who's ever wanted to prove that their art skills peaked in kindergarten.
