## Making pro visuals easy

You know those sleek, professional-looking images you see on developer portfolios? The ones with crisp drop shadows and subtle 3D effects that make you wonder, "How'd they make that look so polished?" Well, surprise – the images you're seeing right now were created using Image Sandbox. That's right, this tool doesn't just talk the talk; it walks the walk.

## Why I Built It

- Figma? Great for designers, overkill for the rest of us.
- Canva? Started simple, now it's a feature jungle.
- Others? Either missing key features or cost an arm and a leg.
- I can't stop coding, even when I should be sleeping.


So, I thought, "Why not build something that just works?"

## What makes Image Sandbox different

1. Quick and dirty: Get in, make something awesome, get out.
2. No account needed: Your projects stick around in your browser.
3. What you see is what you get: No paywalls on the good stuff.

## How we keep the lights on

Sure, it's free to use, but I'm not running a charity:

- Premium templates for the fancy folks who want that extra oomph.
- API access for the tech wizards who want to conjure images on the fly. Think server-side magic for dynamic content generation.
- Cloud sync for the "my office is everywhere" crowd.

Image Sandbox is for anyone who's ever wanted to make their work look good without a degree in graphic design. It's fast, it's simple, and it gets the job done. Give it a spin – your social media game will thank you.
