# Introduction to React Hooks

In this tutorial, we'll explore the basics of React Hooks, a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you should have a basic understanding of React and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

First, let's create a new React project if you haven't already:

```bash filename=my-hooks-app.js
npx create-react-app my-hooks-app
cd my-hooks-app
```

## useState Hook

The **useState** hook lets you add state to functional components. Here's how you can use it:

```jsx filename=app.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, **useState** is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

## useEffect Hook

The **useEffect** Hook lets you perform side effects in function components:

```jsx {3}
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
```go
func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Here, **useEffect** is used to replace lifecycle methods like **componentDidMount**, **componentDidUpdate**, and **componentWillUnmount**.

## Conclusion

Hooks are a powerful feature in React that allow you to use state and other features in functional components. They make your components more reusable and easier to understand.
